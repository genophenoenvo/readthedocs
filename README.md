# Geno Pheno Envo ReadTheDocs documentation

The repo is the Read the Docs documentation in use by the GenoPhenoEnvo project. 

## Goal of the docs

The goal of the documentation is to provide basic learning materials to help researchers, educators, and students effectively use our research material in the CyVerse cyberinfrastructure. 

All documentation is a work-in-progress; even the best efforts will be incomplete, contain ambiguities, inaccuracies, and at some point, out of date. 


## Maintained Sections

We maintain the following templates. All documentation in the Learning Center should be derived from these. They can be adapted slightly, but documentation should strive to be consistently formatted. 
    - URL: https://github.com/genophenoenvo/readthedocs
    
- **Tutorials**: Tutorials to teach how to use our platforms. 

- **Research**: Specific explanations of the research and how to reproduce it

- **Documentation**: Explanation of where data sets are located and how to (re)create our workflows.
