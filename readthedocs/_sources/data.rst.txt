Data Sources
------------

Original data used by this research project come from a variety of existing observatories and other funded research programs.

Processed or derivative data sets produced by our project are being hosted on CyVerse |Data Store| and are accessible via the Data Commons. 

TERRA-REF
*********

The Transportation Energy Resources from Renewable Agriculture Phenotyping Reference Platform (|TerraRef|) aims to transform plant breeding by using remote sensing to quantify plant traits such as plant architecture, carbon uptake, tissue chemistry, water use, and other features to predict the yield potential and stress resistance of 400+ diverse sorghum lines.

For the initial phase of our project we are using the TERRA-REF sorghum data to build our first ML models.

NEON
****

The National Science Foundation's National Ecological Observatory Network (|NEON|) is a continental-scale observation facility operated by Battelle and designed to collect long-term open access ecological data to better understand how U.S. ecosystems are changing. The comprehensive data, spatial extent and remote sensing technology provided by NEON will enable a large and diverse user community to tackle new questions at scales not accessible to previous generations of ecologists.

We are using the NEON |Soil microbe metagenome sequences| data hosted by |MG-RAST|, for our genomics analyses.

We are using NEON meteorological data products
